Version: 0.1.5
Author: Soil and Plant Science Division Staff
Maintainer: Andrew G. Brown <andrew.g.brown@usda.gov>
Description: The goal of soilDBdata is to provide standard methods for building and provisioning test data sets for the soilDB R package. These datasets are stored as SQLite, JSON, CSV in the inst/extdata folder and are buildable by standard methods. Building datasets from scratch may require access to a local instance of a NASIS database with relevant tables populated.
